                <li><strong>WiFi status</strong> will blink at 1Hz when attempting to connect. If successfully connected it will briefly blink every 5 seconds if in STA mode, or every second if the device is still in AP mode.</li>
                <li><strong>Follow switch</strong> will force the LED to follow the status of a given switch (defaults to the 1st switch, use the selector to change it).</li>
                <li><strong>Inverse switch</strong> is same as the above, but using the inverse status as status of the LED.</li>
                <li><strong>Find me</strong> will turn the LED ON when all relays are OFF. This is meant to locate the device at night.</li>
                <li><strong>Find me &amp; WiFi</strong> will also follow the WiFi status, and stay mostly ON when relays are OFF and mostly OFF when any of them are ON.</li>
                <li><strong>Relay status</strong> will turn the LED ON whenever any switch is ON, and OFF otherwise. This is global status notification.</li>
                <li><strong>Relay status &amp; WiFi</strong> will follow the WiFi status but will stay mostly OFF when relays are OFF, and mostly ON when any of them are ON.</li>
                <li><strong>Manually managed</strong> will let you manage the LED status through the API. For example, MQTT will subscribe to the "&lt;base_topic&gt;/led/0/set", sending a payload of 0, 1 or 2 (to toggle it) will change the LED status accordingly.</li>
                <li><strong>Always ON</strong> and <strong>Always OFF</strong> modes are self-explanatory.</li>
